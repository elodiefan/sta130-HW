    "1. Code Breakdown Request:\n",
    "\n",
    "User requested an explanation of the Monty Hall problem code provided. The code simulates the Monty Hall problem, where a player chooses one of three doors, one hiding a car and the others hiding goats. After the initial choice, one losing door is revealed, and the player decides whether to switch their choice to the remaining door.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Explanation Provided:\n",
    "\n",
    "Initialization: The code sets up variables for the doors and the number of simulations (reps).\n",
    "Loop Structure: The code runs a simulation loop, selecting a winning door and removing it from the list of options.\n",
    "Removing Doors: Handles the removal of the player's initial choice and the door revealed by Monty.\n",
    "Switching and Winning: After Monty reveals a losing door, the player switches to the remaining door. The win count is updated based on whether the switched door is the winning door.\n",
    "Result Calculation: Calculates the probability of winning when switching doors.\n"

    "This extension aims to improve the basic Markov chain model by focusing on word pairs rather than single words. It doesn't yet incorporate character-specific behavior, but it's the foundation for capturing more context (via word pairs).\n",

    "Extension #2:\n",
    "Similar to Extension #1, this extension also tracks bigrams (word + ' ' + words[i+1]) but does so per character.\n",

    "**Part 1:** \n",
    "\n",
    "It would be difficult to be a statistician or data scientist without engaging in coding or data analysis, as these are integral aspects of both professions. However, there are nuances to consider:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Statisticians\n",
    "Role: Statisticians focus on designing experiments, collecting data, and applying statistical methods to interpret results. Coding and data analysis are critical tools they use to manipulate data and apply statistical techniques.\n",
    "Without Coding: While some statisticians may not need deep programming expertise, it would be challenging to work effectively without any coding. Most statistical work today is done using tools like R, Python, or specialized software (e.g., SAS, SPSS). Without these, performing complex analyses on large datasets would be difficult.\n",
    "Alternative: If coding isn't a strong suit, statisticians could work more on theoretical statistics or focus on roles that involve consulting and designing statistical models while relying on analysts or data scientists to execute the technical aspects.\n",
